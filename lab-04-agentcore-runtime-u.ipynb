    "## Lab 4: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 3 we scaled our Customer Support Agent by centralizing tools through AgentCore Gateway with secure authentication. Now we'll complete the production journey by deploying our agent to AgentCore Runtime with comprehensive observability. This will transform our prototype into a production-ready system that can handle real-world traffic with full monitoring and automatic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) is a secure, fully managed runtime that empowers organizations to deploy and scale AI agents in production, regardless of framework, protocol, or model choice. It provides enterprise-grade reliability, automatic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done):** Create Agent Prototype - Built a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Done):** Enhance with Memory - Added conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3 (Done):** Scale with Gateway & Identity - Shared tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4 (Current):** Deploy to Production - Used AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5:** Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Runtime & Production Deployment Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State (Lab 1-3): Agent runs locally with centralized tools but faces production challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent runs locally in a single session\n",
    "- No comprehensive monitoring or debugging capabilities\n",
    "- Cannot handle multiple concurrent users reliably\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lab, we will have a production-ready agent infrastructure with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serverless auto-scaling to handle variable demand\n",
    "- Comprehensive observability with traces, metrics, and logging\n",
    "- Enterprise reliability with automatic error recovery\n",
    "- Secure deployment with proper access controls\n",
    "- Easy management through AWS console and APIs and support for real-world production workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding comprehensive observability with AgentCore Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AgentCore Runtime integrates seamlessly with [AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) to provide full visibility into your agent's behavior in production. AgentCore Observability automatically captures traces, metrics, and logs from your agent interactions, tool usage, and memory access patterns. In this lab we will see how AgentCore Runtime integrates with CloudWatch GenAI Observability to provide comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For request tracing, AgentCore Observability captures the complete conversation flow including tool invocations, memory retrievals, and model interactions. For performance monitoring, it tracks response times, success rates, and resource utilization to help optimize your agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the observability flow, AgentCore Runtime automatically instruments your agent code and sends telemetry data to CloudWatch. You can then use CloudWatch dashboards and GenAI Observability features to analyze patterns, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture for Lab 4\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:left\"> \n",
    "    <img src=\"images/architecture_lab4_runtime.png\" width=\"75%\"/> \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Agent now runs in AgentCore Runtime with full observability through CloudWatch, serving production traffic with auto-scaling and comprehensive monitoring. Memory and Gateway integrations from previous labs remain fully functional in the production environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serverless Agent Deployment:** Transform your local agent into a scalable production service using AgentCore Runtime with minimal code changes\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Observability:** Full request tracing, performance metrics, and debugging capabilities through CloudWatch GenAI Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.12+\n",
    "- AWS account with appropriate permissions\n",
    "- Docker, Finch or Podman installed and running\n",
    "- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore SDK\n",
    "- Strands Agents framework\n",
    "- **Lab 3 Completion:** This lab builds on Lab 3 (AgentCore Gateway). You MUST run [lab-03-agentcore-gateway](lab-03-agentcore-gateway.ipynb) to provision the gateway before running this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You MUST enable [CloudWatch Transaction Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Enable-TransactionSearch.html) to be able to see AgentCore Observability traces in CloudWatch.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Runtime-Ready Agent\n",

    "4. Let AgentCore Runtime control the execution with `app.run()`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Implementation Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "The runtime-ready agent uses an entrypoint function that extracts user prompts from the payload and JWT tokens from request headers via \n",
    "context.request_headers.get('Authorization', ''). The authorization token is then propagated directly to the AgentCore Gateway by passing it in the \n",
    "MCP client headers: headers={\"Authorization\": auth_header}. The implementation includes error handling for missing authentication and returns plain \n",

Here's a comprehensive guide:\\n\\n## Installing a New CPU: Technical Documentation\\n\\n### Pre-Installation Preparation:\\n\\n1. **Compatibility Check**: \\n   - Ensure the new CPU is compatible with your motherboard socket type\\n   - Verify BIOS support for the new CPU model\\n   - Check power supply capabilities for higher-end CPUs\\n\\n2. **Gather Required Tools**:\\n   - Anti-static wrist strap\\n   - Thermal paste\\n   - Isopropyl alcohol and lint-free cloth (for cleaning old thermal paste)\\n   - Phillips-head screwdriver\\n   - CPU cooler (stock or aftermarket)\\n\\n### Installation Process:\\n\\n1. **Safety First**:\\n   - Power down the system completely\\n   - Unplug all power cables\\n   - Press power button to discharge residual electricity\\n   - Use anti-static measures (wrist strap, work on non-carpeted surface)\\n\\n2. **Accessing the CPU Socket**:\\n   - Remove side panel of computer case\\n   - If upgrading, remove the existing CPU cooler\\n   - Clean old thermal paste from the CPU heat spreader\\n\\n3. **CPU Installation**:\\n   - Locate the CPU socket on motherboard\\n   - Release the retention lever/mechanism\\n   - Align the CPU notches with socket (triangular marker in corner)\\n   - Gently place CPU in socket without forcing it\\n   - Lower retention arm to secure the CPU\\n\\n4. **Thermal Solution**:\\n   - Apply appropriate amount of thermal paste (pea-sized dot)\\n   - Install CPU cooler according to manufacturer instructions\\n   - Connect CPU fan header to motherboard\\n\\n5. **Verification**:\\n   - Reconnect all cables\\n   - Boot system and enter BIOS to verify CPU detection\\n   - Check temperature readings under idle conditions\\n\\n### Post-Installation:\\n\\n1. **BIOS Update**:\\n   - Consider updating BIOS to latest version for best compatibility\\n   - Monitor temperatures during initial use\\n\\n2. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**:\\n   - System not booting: Check CPU installation and power connections\\n   - Overheating: Verify thermal paste application and cooler mounting\\n   - Performance issues: Check BIOS settings and power management\\n\\nWould you like more specific information about installing a CPU for a particular system or brand? I notice from your preferences that you're interested in ThinkPad laptops and Linux compatibility. While CPU replacement is more common in desktop systems, I can also provide information about laptop CPU upgrades if that's what you're looking for.\"\n"

    "### Congratulations! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "You have successfully completed **Lab 4: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with Observability!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what you accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Production-Ready Deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepared your agent for production with minimal code changes (only 4 lines added)\n",
    "- Validated proper session isolation between different customers\n",
    "- Confirmed session continuity + memory persistence and context awareness per session\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Enterprise-Grade Security & Identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented secure authentication using Cognito integration with JWT tokens\n",
    "- Configured proper IAM roles and execution permissions for production workloads\n",
    "- Established identity-based access control for secure agent invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comprehensive Observability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enabled AgentCore Observability for full request tracing across all customer sessions\n",
    "- Configured CloudWatch GenAI Observability dashboard monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Current Limitations (We'll fix these next!):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Developer Focused Interaction** - Agent accessible via SDK/API calls but no user-friendly web interface\n",
    "- **Manual Session Management** - Requires programmatic session creation rather than intuitive user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Next Up [Lab 5: Build User Interface →](lab-05-frontend.ipynb)\n",
    "In Lab 5, you'll complete the customer experience by building a user-friendly interface !! Lets go !!\n"
